# Single-Linear-Regression
Homemade single linear regression `y = theta0 + theta1 * x`

## Linear Regression algorithm
In this project, I implemented by using gradient descent and batch learning.

Too busy to implement with stochastic and mini-batch.

## Language implementation
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust
